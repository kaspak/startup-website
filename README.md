# About
This is a basic HTML/CSS demo website for a (fake) startup called StartUp. I created this website to practice HTML/CSS I learned from Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy.

# Features
- containers using divs
- social media links for display (links to none of the official sites)
- filler descriptions to test with padding and margins
- a contact button linked to the mailto feature
- personal favicon from free-to-use stock images

# What I learned
- Web design while referencing other websites to design StartUp
- Proper padding and margins (the difference between the two and how to fix spacing issues)
- Heavily relied on the browser inspector feature for debugging and learned how to use the tool
- Referencing documentation for fixing issues or adding new features
